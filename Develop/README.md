## A challenge to make weather forecast API calls and store searches in local storage.

I created a webpage that takes a city name and returns the current weather for a given city.

## Installation

## Usage

I created a webpage that takes a city name and returns the current weather for a given city in a large box, then returns a five day forecast separated by 3-hour increments in small cards. The city name search is then stored in local storage and a button is created to save that search. The button can be clicked to re-run the search for that city or a new city name can be searched.
